Here we have a few examples of how to handle python package xlutils.
When I first started coding in python, my first impression was a lack of documentation. So this is why 
I'm creating this folder inside xlutils package.
In order to make my life easier, I created a base.py module that contain a function to point out to the file directory.
Note that you also need the ini.py file.
